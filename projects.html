                <p>This was the first project I began when I got my first VPS, a pretty basic fullstack project, Discord webapp being my frontend and all the backend my VPS with Python.</p>

                <p>Honestly the project I am more proud of, yet the most challenging I have faced, creating an operating system completely from scratch. No libraries, no api, nothing, bare metal C and x86-64 assembly.</p>
