                    During my life I have always been interested in the world of tech and creating private useful software for particular people online for fun purposes,
                    such as games (lots of gamehacking and reverse engineering), plugins, basic webserver hosting, advising tech and hardware, sometimes creating public videos on YouTube and other servicies such as creating a big public
                    community online to help new people interested in programming to get motivated getting helping on specific tasks such as guiding the steps to achieve solutions to a lot of uni students, 
                    could be compared following the purpose of StackOverflow in a more friendly way.<br><br>
